Please read the **[Safety Guide](https://github.com/trigger-segfault/TriggersPC/wiki/Safety-Guide)** before using Trigger's PC. Emulators like VBA has some strange behaviors that many people are not aware of, such as overwriting the game save when closing the application. Things like this can (and will) cause issues if you also have these saves open in Trigger's PC. The number one rule is **never run a game save in an emulator, and in Trigger's PC at the same time!**

Trigger's PC is a tool designed for legit purposes. There really aren't enough tools for legit-play out there sadly. However, note it does extend some of the boundaries of the game to increase replayability and customization.

(Sorry for the horribly messy code)
